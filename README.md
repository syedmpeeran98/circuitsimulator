# circuitsimulator
Optimization of electrical circuit simulation is done here by the implementation of a priority queue in place of a highly inefficient data structure. This is done by profiling the said simulator and detecting the methods with high time complexity and replacing them with efficient methods. The built-in python profiler can be used for profiling the simulator.
